# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data


### Introduction

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 

This submission contains: 1) a tidy data set as described below, 2) a link to a Github repository with the script for performing the analysis, and 3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that were performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. Also included is this README.md in the repo that explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.

### Included Files

**run_analysis.R:** The R file that reads UCI HAR data and outputs a tidy data set. 

**Tidy_Step5.txt:** The tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject referenced in step 5 above.

**CodeBook.MD:** A codebook that describes the variables and summaries calculated

**README.MD:** This file that includes a description of repo contents
